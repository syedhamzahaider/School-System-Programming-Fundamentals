# School System Project

This is a school system project implemented in C++ as part of a programming fundamentals course. The project aims to simulate an admission form and provide course selection based on the student's chosen discipline. It also includes an exam section to calculate the student's percentage and determine their pass/fail status.

## Features

- User-friendly interface with ASCII art and clear instructions
- Admission form for entering student marks and personal information
- Discipline selection for choosing between Computer Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Arts
- Course details and notification for the start of classes
- Exam section for entering subject marks and calculating the percentage
- Pass/fail status determination based on the total marks
- Modular code structure using functions for improved readability
- Visual elements to enhance the user experience

## Getting Started

To run the school system project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd school-system-project
   ```

3. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o school_system
   ```

4. Run the executable file:
   ```
   ./school_system
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program.
